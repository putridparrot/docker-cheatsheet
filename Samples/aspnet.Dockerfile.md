# A Node server within docker

The [aspnet.Dockerfile](aspnet.Dockerfile) contains a simple script for building a container from an ASP.NET core server app. 

_This Dockerfile was generated by Visual Studio 2022_


* Copy the [aspnet.Dockerfile](aspnet.Dockerfile) to your ASP.NET core solution's root folder
* Use can use this name, but I'll rename to Dockerfile
* From your CLI run 

```
docker build -t ReplaceWithImageTagName .
```

This file will copy your files to the container and install dependencies etc.

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 ReplaceWithImageTagName
```

This will show output from yarn. Add the _-d_ option, i.e.

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ReplaceWithImageTagName
```
